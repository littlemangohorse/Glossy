public extension VisualEffect {
	
	/// Applies a variable blur, with the blur radius at each pixel determined by a mask image.
	///
	/// - Tip: To automatically generate a mask image of the same size as the view, use ``SwiftUI/View/variableBlur(radius:maxSampleCount:verticalPassFirst:maskRenderer:)`` which creates the image from drawing instructions you provide to a `GraphicsContext`.
	///
	/// - Parameters:
	///   - radius: The maximum radial size of the blur in areas where the mask is fully opaque.
	///   - maxSampleCount: The maximum number of samples to take from the view's layer in each direction. Higher numbers produce a smoother, higher quality blur but are more GPU intensive. Values larger than `radius` have no effect.
	///   - verticalPassFirst: Whether or not to perform the vertical blur pass before the horizontal one. Changing this parameter may reduce smearing artifacts. Defaults to `false`, i.e. perform the horizontal pass first.
	///   - mask: An image with an alpha channel to use as mask to determine the strength of the blur effect at each pixel. Fully transparent areas are unblurred; fully opaque areas are blurred by the full radius; partially transparent areas are blurred by the radius multiplied by the alpha value. The mask will be uv-mapped to cover the entire view.
	///   - isEnabled: Whether the effect is enabled or not.
	/// - Returns: A new view that renders `self` with the blur shader applied as a layer effect.
	///
	/// - Important: Because this effect is based on SwiftUI's `layerEffect`, views backed by AppKit or UIKit views may not render. Instead, they log a warning and display a placeholder image to highlight the error.
